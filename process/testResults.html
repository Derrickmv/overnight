            The audience test was super helpful for getting feedback on how people other than myself navigate through my game. I'm going to have to put in little tutorials within the game since I specifically told them to read instructions first (other people may not do so since they aren't told to). I could also put an alert at the beginning to tell the user to read the instructions. I had a problem with my video in which if it was already played, the video would not reset and it would just be a blank screen where the video was supposed to be, but I've researched how to reset the video, so I'll have to put that code in. I also have to indicate when dialogue ends because one user wasn't sure if they should move on to the next scene or to wait for more dialogue to show up. It's difficult because I have to make sure dialogue shows long enough for people to read, but short enough where they know more is coming. Also, everyone reads at different speeds, so I'll have to figure out an average.
